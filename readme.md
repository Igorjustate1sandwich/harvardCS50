# Learning with CS50 (Harvard Intro to Comp Sci 2019/2020)
Learning programming with Harvard CS50.
**This repo is where I begun my programming journey.** I used Harvard CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) as a means to jump into the programming world.
* Completion status: Completed (Jan 2020)
* Certificate: Yes. Viewable on Linkedin. 

## Repo Structure
Repo consists of two "languages" folders and a "pset" folder. 
* The languages folders (C, Python) contain unorganized code and exercised related to CS50 that I completed for my own academic benefit. 
* Additionally, CS50 consisted of 22 mandatory problem sets (psets). You will find my solutions to these psets in the psets folder.
