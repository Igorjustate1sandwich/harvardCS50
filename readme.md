# Learning Programming in CS50 (Harvard Introduction to Computer Science 2019/2020)
This repo is where I begun my programming journey. I used Harvard CS50 as my main learning resource. 
Completion status: Completed (Jan 2020)
Certificate: Viewable on Linkedin. 

## Repo Structure
Repo consists of two "languages" folders and a "pset" folder. 
* The languages folders (C, Python) contain unorganized code and exercised related to CS50 that I completed for my own academic benefit. 
* Additionally, CS50 consisted of 22 mandatory problem sets (psets). You will find my solutions to these psets in the psets folder.
